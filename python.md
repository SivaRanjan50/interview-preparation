### 1. What are the basic data types in Python?
```
  python has several built-in data types
  1. Numeric types: int (integers), float (floating-point numbers), and complex (complex numbers)
  2. Text type: str (strings)
  3. Boolean type: bool (True/False)
  4. Sequence types: list, tuple, and range
  5. Mapping type: dict (dictionaries)
  6. Set types: set and frozenset
  7. Binary types: bytes, bytearray, and memoryview
  8. Special type: NoneType (None value)
  Additionally, Python has collection types like lists, tuples, and dictionaries that are
  built from these basic types."
```
### 2. What's the difference between list and tuple?
```
"Lists and tuples are both sequence types in Python, but they have key differences:
  1. Mutability: Lists are mutable (can be modified after creation), while tuples are
     immutable (cannot be changed once created).
  2. Syntax: Lists use [], tuples use () or just commas.
  3. Performance: Tuples are generally faster and more memory-efficient than lists due to their immutability.
  4. Use Cases: Use lists for dynamic collections that need modification, and tuples for fixed data, dictionary keys,
     or multiple return values from functions.
  5. Hashability: Tuples can be used as dictionary keys (if all elements are hashable), while lists cannot."
